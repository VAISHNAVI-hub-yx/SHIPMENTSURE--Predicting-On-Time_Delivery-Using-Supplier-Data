Shipment Sure: Predicting On-Time Delivery Using Supplier Data

Shipment Sure is a Machine Learning–based project that predicts whether a shipment will be delivered on time or delayed using supplier and logistics data.
The goal is to help logistics companies and suppliers analyze delivery performance, reduce delays, and optimize operations with data-driven insights.

🚀 Key Features

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical data, and engineered new features.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncovered insights and visualized shipment trends using Seaborn & Matplotlib.

🤖 Model Development: Implemented and compared multiple ML algorithms —
Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.

🏆 Model Optimization: Fine-tuned hyperparameters using Optuna for best performance.

💡 Explainability with SHAP: Visualized how each feature impacts predictions.

🌐 Interactive Streamlit App: Built a user-friendly dashboard for data exploration, model comparison, and real-time shipment delay prediction.
